On 2 December 1994 during her tenure, law enforcement raided Most-Bank. In late April 1995, Vladimir Vinogradov was very critical of Paramonova's leadership of the Central Bank and, subsequently, the Duma never approved her as the chairman of the Bank of Russia. On 24 August 1995 or \"Black Thursday\", the Moscow market for interbank loans collapsed which became the basis for Paramonova stepping down as acting head of the Central Bank on 8 November 1995. Sergei Konstantinovich Dubinin (Сергей Константинович Дубинин; born 10 December 1950 Moscow, Soviet Union), who was the former deputy chairman of the board of Imperial Bank which was led by Sergey Rodionov and focused on oil and natural gas supplies to East Germany and later to Germany including the oil-for-pipes program, replaced Paramonova and was approved by the Duma on 22 November 1995 to be the chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. Previously, Sergey Dubinin had been the acting finance minister of Russia from January 1994 until October 1994 when he was fired following the events of \"Black Tuesday\"."
